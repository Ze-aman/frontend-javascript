# frontend-javascript

This repository contains exercises for **frontend development using JavaScript, TypeScript, and SASS**.  
The projects cover SASS compilation, TypeScript interfaces, classes, advanced types, namespaces, and other frontend concepts as part of the **ALX Frontend ProDev**.

## Features

- **TypeScript Interface**
  - `Student` interface with the following properties:
    - `firstName`: string
    - `lastName`: string
    - `age`: number
    - `location`: string
- **Student Array**
  - Creates two students and stores them in an array `studentsList`.
- **DOM Rendering**
  - Dynamically renders a table containing the `firstName` and `location` of each student using vanilla JavaScript.
- **Type Safety**
  - All variables and functions use TypeScript types for improved reliability.
- **Webpack Integration**
  - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript with no type errors.
